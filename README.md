# WpfTex

A user control to typeset LaTeX math expressions in WPF. It was initally intended as a tool to render equations in WPF, but it became more of an excercise in implementing a parser. I've reached a limit with my ability to implement more LaTeX commands, but I intend to return to this project when I'm in a better position to learn how to more effectively parse the content.

Currently supports super, sub, and super-sub scripts; all the Greek letters; several spacing commands; and roman and math-italic fonts. It uses unicode versions of the original Computer-Modern fonts under the Open Font Licence. The control also has limited data-binding and design-time capabilities.
